# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. In the telecommunications industry, this is a significant challenge due to high competition and the ease with which customers can switch providers. With annual churn rates ranging from 15% to 25%, understanding and reducing churn is crucial for business sustainability.

This project analyzes a dataset of 7,043 telecom customers to identify key drivers of churn and visualize customer trends using an interactive Power BI dashboard.
